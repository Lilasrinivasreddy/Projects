ðŸ”§ Code Changes Made
1. New Prompts Added (prompts.py)
I added two new prompt templates at the end of your existing prompts:

Read prompts.py, lines 580 to 650

2. New Pydantic Models (pydantic_parsers.py)
Let me check what Pydantic models I added:

Read pydantic_parsers.py, lines 460 to 480

3. New Service Functions (services.py)
I added two new service functions for Vega visualization generation (both metadata-based and sample-based approaches).

4. Updated Flow Agent (flow_agent.py)
I updated the flow agent to use the new Vega system with smart approach selection and to return the new vega_visualizations field.
