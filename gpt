Based on the provided architecture, here are a few suggestions to improve centralization and scalability within Google Cloud Platform (GCP):

1. Use of Google Cloud Pub/Sub for Real-Time Streaming

Current Setup: Currently, there is a mix of real-time and non-real-time logging using Elastic Filebeat and Metricbeat.

Suggestion: Integrate Google Cloud Pub/Sub as an intermediate layer for streaming log and metric data. This allows for real-time processing and decouples data sources from downstream processing systems. Filebeat and Metricbeat can push logs to Pub/Sub, which then forwards data to Cloud Logging, BigQuery, or Dataflow.


2. Consolidate with Google Cloud Operations Suite

Current Setup: You’re using OpsGenie for alerts and a Batch v2 dashboard for monitoring.

Suggestion: Leverage Google Cloud Monitoring and Logging (part of the Google Cloud Operations Suite) as a more integrated approach for alerting, logging, and visualization. This provides a unified view, enabling easier monitoring and alert management with GCP-native tools.

Use Cloud Monitoring dashboards to replace or complement the Batch v2 Dashboard, reducing the need for multiple tools.


3. Switch to Google Cloud Dataflow for ETL Processing

Current Setup: You’re using Java Client Library and Oozie DB queries for data processing and aggregation.

Suggestion: Use Google Cloud Dataflow for scalable ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processing. Dataflow can handle log processing in real-time, process logs as they arrive, and output to BigQuery for storage and analysis. This simplifies and centralizes data processing without depending on individual client libraries and Oozie.


4. Consider Google Bigtable for Scalable Metrics Storage

Current Setup: The current architecture uses Google BQ, Spanner, Druid, and Cassandra for metrics storage.

Suggestion: For high-throughput, time-series data (like metrics), consider Google Bigtable instead of multiple databases. Bigtable is optimized for large-scale analytical and operational workloads, making it a suitable choice for scalable metrics storage and retrieval.


5. Replace Elastic Stack with Google Cloud Logging and Monitoring

Current Setup: Elastic Filebeat and Metricbeat are used for real-time data collection and processing.

Suggestion: Transition to Google Cloud Logging for log collection and Google Cloud Monitoring for metrics, utilizing GCP-native solutions. This approach reduces dependency on external tools and centralizes data collection in a GCP-native environment, improving scalability and management.


6. Optimize Data Retention with Google Cloud Storage

Current Setup: Retention appears limited, with a possible need for long-term storage in an external database.

Suggestion: Use Google Cloud Storage for log archival and storage of data older than six weeks. This approach is cost-effective, particularly for long-term storage, and allows for easy retrieval if needed for audits or historical analysis.


Revised Architecture Flow

1. Data Collection: Filebeat/Metricbeat or other collectors send data to Google Cloud Pub/Sub.


2. Aggregation & Processing:

Google Cloud Dataflow subscribes to Pub/Sub for real-time data processing.

Dataflow streams processed data to BigQuery for analysis or Bigtable for scalable metrics storage.



3. Centralized Monitoring & Alerts:

Use Google Cloud Monitoring and Google Cloud Logging to manage logs and metrics, create dashboards, and set up alerts.

Optional integration with OpsGenie for external alerting if needed.



4. Storage & Archival:

BigQuery for metrics and logs needing SQL-based analysis.

Google Cloud Storage for long-term storage, archiving logs older than six weeks.




This revised approach leverages GCP’s native tools for a streamlined, cost-effective, and scalable architecture. Let me know if you'd like a visual representation of this revised architecture.
