How Talk2Report Generates Summary & Follow-up Questions
üìã Complete Flow Explanation
Phase 1: PDF Upload & Initial Processing
When you upload a PDF document, here's what happens:

File Reception: The system receives your PDF through the FastAPI endpoint
Content Extraction: Using PyPDF2, the system extracts text from each page
Intelligent Chunking: The PDF is split into page-based chunks with metadata
Phase 2: Automatic Summary Generation
Location: services.py - generate_report_summary()

Here's the exact process that generates your summary:

Content Combination: All page chunks are combined into one unified text
LLM Prompt Construction: The system creates a specialized prompt:
AI Analysis: Gemini Flash/Pro processes the entire document and generates:
Comprehensive Summary: 200-400 word executive summary
Key Findings: Main insights and data points
Business Value: Actionable recommendations
Phase 3: Follow-up Question Generation
Location: pydantic_parsers.py - report_summarizer_call_parser

The system automatically generates 4 intelligent follow-up questions:

How Questions are Generated:

Content Analysis: LLM analyzes the report's main topics, data points, and themes
Question Categories: Generates questions across different analysis types:
Drill-down: "What are the specific factors driving the 15% revenue increase?"
Comparative: "How do Q3 results compare to the same period last year?"
Trend Analysis: "What patterns can we see in customer acquisition over time?"
Actionable: "What recommendations does the report make for next quarter?"
Phase 4: Vector Embedding & Storage
Location: service.py - _process_and_store_chunks()

After summary generation:

Vector Embeddings: Each chunk gets embedded using text-embedding-004
Database Storage: Chunks stored in PostgreSQL with pgvector for semantic search
Metadata Storage: Summary and questions stored with the main report record
Phase 5: User Interface Display
The response sent to the frontend includes:

üéØ Why This Works So Well
1. Intelligent Content Processing
Full Document Analysis: Unlike simple chunking, the system analyzes the ENTIRE document to generate summaries
Context Preservation: Maintains document structure and relationships between sections
Business Focus: Prompts specifically designed for business analysis and actionable insights
2. Smart Question Generation
Content-Aware: Questions are generated based on actual document content, not templates
Diverse Perspectives: Covers different analysis angles (trends, comparisons, details, actions)
Natural Language: Questions feel conversational and relevant to the specific document
