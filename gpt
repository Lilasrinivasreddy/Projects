Subject: Q-verse Work Update

Hi Ashok and Harry,

Just to keep you updated on the Q-verse work:

We had a KT session yesterday, and a similar session along with a code review was planned for today as well.
As requested by @Shunmugaraj Balasekaran, I had shared the document flow and code overview details with him last Friday.

Currently, I am in the process of getting KT/code walkthrough from @Akhilesh Pothuri. Once that is completed, I will be working on the development of the planner agent.

I will connect with @Shunmugaraj Balasekaran again to get further clarity on the development scope once the KT is completed.

Best regards,
