(0:04) So, if I go to source, so today right for the visualizations, we have this format, yeah (0:23) this one. (0:24) So, we are asking that to predict you know what are the dimensions, measures, chart type, (0:28) chart title and you know the name metadata. (0:31) Metadata is basically referring to sort filters and limitations and stuff.
(0:35) Okay. (0:36) Okay. (0:37) So, this is the current visualization structure.
(0:40) So, this we want to switch to VegaConfig. (0:43) So, VegaConfig looks something like this. (0:47) This is like a standard structure for visualizations.
(0:53) So, what we can do is, can you change the prompt, like write a new prompt for visualization (1:01) where instead of responding back in this structure, it should respond back in Vega structure. (1:08) So, just look at Vega documents or Vega documentation. (1:11) Yeah, you share that link Akhilesh, I will go to that Vega document, Vega JSON file.
(1:16) Okay. (1:17) Yeah. (1:17) There is nothing you would have to give, right.
(1:20) You just have to exclusively mention that, return the suggested visualization in Vega (1:25) format, that's it. (1:26) Yes, yes. (1:27) Right.
(1:28) So, just look at it, just find in the prompt to get all kinds of details, like you know (1:33) the tooltips, access, grid, grid colors or whatever information is there, right. (1:38) Oh. (1:38) Just say it is the required information and it is coming out in a correct format, right.
(1:44) Now, the other thing is, when it is giving you the Vega config, so in the form today (1:54) we have certain checks that we do. (2:02) So, when we are suggesting a visualization, we look for certain checks. (2:07) First is the data frame size.
(2:09) Okay. (2:11) You should give me a second. (2:14) Oh, yeah.
(2:23) So, for visualization what we do is, we kind of get the metadata of the visualization. (2:27) Metadata refers to the statistics. (2:29) Okay.
(2:30) So, we are not passing data frame directly, it is passing the statistics of that data (2:34) frame, right. (2:35) So, the statistics is defined something like this, where we are sending the unique counts, (2:39) unique values, missing values or like you know categorical values, whatever the summary, (2:44) right. (2:45) Okay.
(2:45) We are trying to send the statistic information to get the visualization. (2:49) So, try with the same thing first and also in parallel do another check where, other (2:55) thing where you do, take the first 100 records or you know take random 100 records. (3:03) Like say if you have a data frame with 5000 records, right.
(3:06) Just take a sample 100 records, any random 100 records and pass it down into the prompt. (3:12) Okay. (3:12) Instead of the metadata, you just pass the data frame, those are sample records.
(3:17) And in the prompt, it is explicitly mentioned that you know you are sending a sample records (3:20) and now this is not the exact representation of the data or whatever it is, right. (3:24) Send that to it, see how it, how is it responding in that case. (3:29) Okay.
(3:29) Yeah. (3:30) Okay. (3:30) And other thing is when it is responding or when it is giving you the Vega configuration, (3:35) what it will do is, it will put the data also in that same computation.
(3:39) Okay. (3:39) In same JSON, it will give you the data frame as well. (3:43) Okay.
(3:43) So, now what happens is if you send the random 100 records, it is going to take those random (3:48) 100 records and put it in the JSON. (3:51) Okay. (3:51) And you will have to replace it with the exact 5000 records whatever you have, right.
(3:56) Okay. (3:56) You will have to replace it. (3:58) Okay.
(3:59) Okay. (4:00) Yeah. (4:01) Just explore this part, we will discuss again tomorrow.
(4:05) Sure. (4:05) Okay. (4:07) And regarding the documentation, I will connect with Anjali.
(4:11) Yeah. (4:12) Just check with Anjali. (4:13) Okay.
(4:13) Okay. (4:14) Sure. (4:14) I will look this.
(4:15) Just a simple single HTML page where, you know, you just put some screenshot, okay. (4:20) I just give directions to the user, right. (4:23) So, like you just say the user is an admin person and they have access to admin tools (4:27) like metadata updation or something, right.
(4:30) How do they update the context? (4:32) How do they update metadata and all the instructions? (4:35) Sure. (4:36) So, who wants to upload with the column, they just come and click on the column description (4:40) and stuff, right. (4:41) Yeah.
(4:42) But just some examples like that and how do they play around with the domain catalog and (4:45) then, you know, talk to data, talk to report, talk to MSP, whatever. (4:48) So, they give that instruction. (4:51) I think that is all.
(4:52) Just one or two pages, that is all. (4:54) Sure. (4:54) Sure.
(4:54) That is all. (4:55) After HTML, then now we run, we will just put it up here next to documentation. (4:59) We will just put that into here.
(5:02) Okay. (5:02) Yeah. (5:03) Yeah.
(5:07) Yeah. (5:10) Yeah. (5:11) Yeah.
(5:11) Yeah.
