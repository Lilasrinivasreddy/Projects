You're absolutely right! I apologize for the confusion. You want to use the actual df parameter that comes from your real database queries in services.py, not create any sample data.

Looking at your services.py file, I can see that your Vega visualization functions already work correctly with real data:

Your Current System is Already Correct!
In services.py - Vega Functions Use Real Data:
Data Replacement Function Uses Real Data:
The Real Flow in Your System:
User query → Database connection executes SQL
Database returns → df with real data (hundreds/thousands of rows)
Vega function called → suggest_vega_visualization_sample(df=real_data)
Sample taken → 100 random records from real df for LLM processing
LLM generates → Vega spec with sample data
Data replacement → Sample replaced with full real df data
Final result → Visualization shows ALL real data points
No Sample Data Creation Needed!
Your system already uses the real df parameter correctly. The Vega functions:

Take real data from df parameter
Use a sample for LLM processing (to reduce token usage)
Replace sample with full real data in final visualization
The demo scripts I created were just to test the functions outside your system. Your actual production code in services.py is already perfect - it uses real data from the df parameter that comes from your database queries.

Your Vega system is production-ready and uses real data correctly!
