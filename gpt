Endpoints, in turn, are the same functions, like the end-to-end flow has to be in a sink. Okay? So that way we can handle concurrent requests. You go through, or just open the flag there to see the endpoints, or even compute, or even cache. Look for the respective codes. Right? And just change everything into a sink. Okay? I'll give you the .env, I'm running it in the local list. It's the same, the way you were doing this a second ago, it's the same thing. The .env will change, I'll give you the .env. Okay. So I will just go through this app.py file, and, okay. This, I think, I will try to get. Let's think first of what is the latest branch, so let's take a look at the latest branch. Okay. Okay.




Got it üëç
Here‚Äôs how I‚Äôd break this down based on what you‚Äôre saying:

1. Endpoints ‚Üí Sink Functions

Every endpoint (API route) in your app.py should be treated as a sink.

That means the function should handle the entire end-to-end flow: receiving request ‚Üí processing (compute/cache/flag logic) ‚Üí returning response.

By doing this, concurrency is handled cleanly because each request runs through its own sink.


2. Places to Check

Flags: If you‚Äôve set feature flags or toggles, check the code path where endpoints rely on them.

Compute layer: Any business logic / service call inside endpoints should now be aligned to sink-style execution.

Cache layer: If you‚Äôre using Redis, local cache, or in-memory dict, ensure endpoint sinks write/read consistently.


3. Handling Concurrent Requests

With sink-style endpoints, async/await (if using FastAPI/Starlette/Quart) or worker pool (if Flask + Gunicorn) ensures concurrency.

Shared resources (e.g., cache, db client) should be thread/process safe.

Avoid global mutable state unless you wrap it in locks or move it into Redis/DB.


4. .env Considerations

Since you‚Äôll give me the .env, that will control:

DB connections

Cache settings

API keys

Flags (like ENABLE_SINK=True)


Running locally just means swapping .env values, no code changes.


5. Next Steps

1. Pull the latest branch (to confirm what‚Äôs already merged).


2. Open app.py ‚Üí Identify all endpoints (@app.get, @app.post, etc.).


3. For each endpoint:

Wrap into a sink function that orchestrates compute/cache/flag.

Replace direct calls with sink logic.



4. Test locally with .env provided.

üëâ Do you want me to go through your app.py and mark exactly which endpoints need to be converted into sinks, step by step?
