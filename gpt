(0:04) So, let us see if you can connect with Anjali, I think she is going to come back in an hour (0:16) she is off right now. (0:17) Sure, sure, I will connect with her, I will check on that accuracy part. (0:21) So, the same thing I have to integrate over here, right? (0:24) Right, same thing, yes.
(0:26) It is again, it is just an LLM approach, so you will have to just create a prompt, call (0:30) this and you know, generate it. (0:32) So, we can do that. (0:34) Okay.
(0:35) Other thing is, Anirban had some other metrics as well, right, that he wanted to bring in. (0:41) So, maybe Yogi, you can check with Anirban what are the metrics you wanted to see and (0:44) you know, you can bring those in. (0:49) Okay.
(0:50) Yeah, just double check with Anirban, right, once, what metrics you wanted. (0:54) Probably have the issue cut first before going to Anirban, just have the issue cut first. (0:57) So, I will just show him what, you know, whatever we discussed in Baltimore and then (1:01) ask him for the additional tricks.
(1:04) Sure, Aklesh. (1:06) Okay. (1:10) So, that is good.
(1:11) So, no other blockers, right? (1:13) Only the DB connections I need to cross check once again, because this CSV file, how we (1:18) are, other than that, nothing Aklesh. (1:22) Okay. (1:22) I will inform you in a while regarding that.
(1:25) Okay. (1:27) Okay, good. (1:27) CSP file is one thing right, but this golden questions you are currently pulling it from CSP right as part of the framework? (1:34) So this CSP, from that script, whatever Yogesh is running that script for testing right.
(1:40) So that CSP sample I have taken. (1:41) Okay, okay that's fine. (1:44) So what we'll do is once you have that right, we'll put it on the GCP bucket and read it from there.
(1:49) Rather than from CSP file right, we'll read the golden set of questions from GCP buckets based on domains and categories. (1:55) Okay, yeah got it. (1:56) Yeah, okay.
