Slide 1: Introduction to OpenTelemetry
What is OpenTelemetry?
OpenTelemetry is an open-source framework for observability.
It collects, processes, and exports telemetry data (traces, metrics, logs) to monitor and debug complex distributed systems.
Core Components:
Traces: Track requests across services with spans, visualizing the full lifecycle.
Metrics: Monitor system performance (latency, throughput, error rates).
Logs: Capture event details and correlate with traces for easier debugging.
Slide 2: Key Features & Benefits
Unified Observability:

Combines traces, metrics, and logs into a single framework.
Real-Time Monitoring & Error Detection:

Detect errors and performance issues in real-time.
Scalability & Flexibility:

Suitable for both small apps and large systems, integrating with cloud platforms.
Automatic & Custom Instrumentation:

Auto-instrumentation for common libraries and custom spans for specific needs.
Cost-Effective & Extensible:

Open-source and supports custom integrations and exporters.
Slide 3: Practical Implementation & Visualization
Implementation:

Install SDKs, instrument libraries (auto and custom), and export data to platforms (e.g., Google Cloud Trace).
Use the OpenTelemetry Collector for data aggregation.
Visualizing Data:

Use Jaeger for visualizing traces and identifying bottlenecks across services.
