Slide 1 – QVerse Framework (Intro + Talk to Data)

The QVerse Framework has 3 different approaches:

Talk to Data → Natural language → SQL queries → Live Databases

Talk to Report → Question answering → Reports (PDFs/Docs)

Talk to Knowledge → Conversational insights from enterprise knowledge base (optional extension)

Talk to Data

What it does

Converts natural language questions → SQL queries

Validates, retries, and executes on live databases (Postgres, BigQuery, Snowflake, etc.)

Uses ThinkForge cache to avoid regeneration for repeated queries

Returns results with AI summaries & chart recommendations

Streams answers back in real-time

Flow (Simple):

User Question → Validation → Cache Check → SQL Generation → Execution → Summary + Visualization

Slide 2 – Talk to Report

What it does

Converts reports (PDF, Docs) into searchable chunks with embeddings

Uses RAG (Vector Search + Reranker + LLM) to answer questions from reports

Provides concise answers with citations to the original document

Supports multiple reports for knowledge discovery

Ideal for archived or unstructured documents

Flow (Simple):

Upload Report → Chunk & Embed → Vector Search → LLM Answer → Citations to Source


⚡ Key Difference

Talk to Data → Real-time answers from live structured data

Talk to Report → Knowledge retrieval from static unstructured reports

👉 Do you want me to also add Slide 3 with a side-by-side comparison table (Talk to Data vs Talk to Report) so it becomes a quick interview “cheat sheet”?





GitHub Copilot
I'll help you create a comprehensive explanation for "Talk to Data" (which appears to be the main SQL query generation system in your project). Let me first examine the relevant components to understand the complete architecture.

Summarized conversation history

I'll provide a comprehensive step-by-step explanation of the "Talk to Data" feature, similar to what I did for Talk2Report. Let me first gather some additional context about the Talk to Data implementation.

Read flow_agent.py, lines 1 to 50

Read flow_agent.py, lines 100 to 150

Read flow_agent.py, lines 200 to 250

Read flow_agent.py, lines 350 to 400

Read flow_agent.py, lines 500 to 600

Read flow_agent.py, lines 700 to 800

Now let me check the main orchestration method to understand the complete Talk to Data flow:

Searched text for async def main_flow (**/src/agents/flow_agent.py), no results

Searched text for def process (**/src/agents/flow_agent.py), no results

Searched text for def run (**/src/agents/flow_agent.py), no results

Read flow_agent.py, lines 1000 to 1100

Read flow_agent.py, lines 1200 to 1268

Now let me check the main controller/router to understand the complete orchestration:

Read controller.py, lines 1 to 50

Searched text for async def ask (**/src/app/routers/genie/controller.py), no results

Read controller.py, lines 280 to 350

Now let me check the Genie service which orchestrates the Talk to Data flow:

Read service.py, lines 1 to 100

Read service.py, lines 100 to 200

Perfect! Now I have a comprehensive understanding of the Talk to Data feature. Let me provide a detailed, step-by-step explanation similar to what I did for Talk2Report.
