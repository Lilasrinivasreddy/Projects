Based on the complete conversation, here is a detailed summary of the best approach to achieve centralized, scalable log and metric collection across an on-prem Hadoop cluster (running Oozie) and Google Cloud Platform (GCP). I’ll provide both the suggested architecture and considerations that account for hybrid cloud integration, scalability, and efficiency.

Best Approach for Log and Metric Collection
Architecture Overview
The architecture involves a hybrid cloud solution where logs and metrics are collected from an on-prem Hadoop cluster and then transferred to GCP for centralized processing, storage, monitoring, and alerting. The architecture leverages both on-prem and cloud-native services to ensure seamless data flow and scalability.

Key Components and Flow
On-Premise Data Collection and Aggregation:

Oozie Job Logs and Metrics:
Collect logs and metrics related to running, pending, succeeded, and failed jobs using Kafka on-prem.
Kafka acts as a reliable messaging and buffering solution to ensure data durability before sending it to the cloud.
Hybrid Data Flow Integration:

Kafka to GCP Integration:
Use Apache Kafka to collect logs on-prem and then forward them to Google Cloud Pub/Sub for cloud ingestion.
Kafka’s buffering capability helps ensure no data is lost during the transfer to the cloud, providing reliability.
Centralized Data Processing and Storage on GCP:

Google Cloud Pub/Sub:
Acts as the messaging service for logs and metrics from Kafka, forwarding data to GCP services for processing.
Google Cloud Dataflow:
Use Dataflow to process data from Pub/Sub in real time, transform it as needed, and load it into Google BigQuery for long-term storage.
Dataflow ensures scalability and can handle peaks in log and metric volume with ease.
Centralized Storage and Analysis:

Google BigQuery:
Store processed data (both logs and metrics) for analytical purposes.
BigQuery provides a serverless environment that can handle large-scale queries and allows for efficient reporting.
Google Cloud Storage:
Archive older logs (more than six weeks old) to Cloud Storage to reduce costs while maintaining access to historical data.
Monitoring and Alerting:

Google Cloud Logging and Cloud Monitoring:
Use Cloud Logging for log storage and real-time viewing of logs coming from Kafka.
Use Cloud Monitoring for visualizing metrics and setting alerts for job states (such as failed or delayed jobs).
OpsGenie or PagerDuty Integration:
Integrate with OpsGenie for real-time alerting in case of any anomalies or threshold breaches.
Visualization and Reporting:

Looker Studio / Google Cloud Monitoring Dashboards:
Create dashboards for real-time monitoring, visualizations, and reporting using Looker Studio and Cloud Monitoring. This ensures stakeholders can view the current system state and any alerts raised.
Proposed Architecture Diagram Components
On-Prem Hadoop Cluster (with Oozie):

Logs collected using Kafka.
Kafka Connect or MirrorMaker could be used to stream data from on-prem Kafka to GCP.
Data Integration and Flow to GCP:

Google Cloud Pub/Sub: Receives logs and metrics from Kafka, acting as an intermediary between on-prem and GCP.
Google Cloud Dataflow: Processes data from Pub/Sub, transforms it, and sends it to BigQuery or Cloud Logging.
Centralized GCP Services:

Google BigQuery: Stores structured logs and metrics.
Google Cloud Logging: Receives real-time logs for monitoring and analysis.
Google Cloud Monitoring: Collects metrics and allows setting alerts for job failures, performance bottlenecks, etc.
Google Cloud Storage: Archive data older than six weeks for cost efficiency.
Monitoring, Alerts, and Visualization:

Looker Studio / Cloud Monitoring Dashboards: Provides visual dashboards for real-time insights.
OpsGenie: Receives alerts for failures or anomalies detected in metrics and logs.
Benefits of the Proposed Architecture
Scalable and Reliable Data Integration:

Using Kafka for on-prem data aggregation ensures data reliability before it’s sent to the cloud.
Pub/Sub and Dataflow on GCP provide scalability, ensuring that log and metric data is handled efficiently even at scale.
Centralized and Unified Data Management:

GCP provides a centralized platform to manage, process, and store logs and metrics.
It simplifies the overall monitoring, alerting, and visualization, providing a clear picture across the hybrid setup.
Cost Efficiency:

Google BigQuery allows for ad-hoc analysis without the overhead of managing a database.
Logs older than six weeks are archived in Cloud Storage, reducing overall storage costs while maintaining data accessibility.
Seamless Alerting and Visualization:

Real-time alerts using OpsGenie and intuitive dashboards through Looker Studio ensure timely response to issues.
Alternative Considerations
If Kafka integration becomes challenging, another alternative is to use Fluentd on-prem to forward logs directly to Pub/Sub.
Consider using Anthos for more advanced hybrid cloud management if a greater level of integration between on-prem and GCP is required in the future.
Conclusion
The best approach is to utilize a hybrid architecture that takes advantage of both on-prem tools like Kafka and cloud-native tools on GCP for data integration, storage, and analysis. This architecture is scalable, reliable, and cost-efficient, with centralized control and simplified monitoring.
