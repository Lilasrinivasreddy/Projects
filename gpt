🚀 DPF (Data Processing Framework) Project - Complete Overview
Intelligent Document Retrieval & AI-Powered Search System

📊 Executive Summary
This project implements an advanced AI-powered document retrieval system that combines traditional search methods with modern AI technologies to provide intelligent, context-aware answers from enterprise documents.

🎯 Project Overview - What We Built
Core Purpose
Problem Solved: Traditional search returns documents; our system returns intelligent answers with source citations
Business Value: Employees can ask natural language questions and get precise answers from enterprise knowledge base
Technology: Hybrid AI approach combining vector search, keyword search, and large language models
🏗️ System Architecture - Step by Step
Step 1: Data Foundation 📚
Input: PDF files, Confluence pages, SharePoint documents, Jira tickets
Processing: Documents are chunked into searchable segments
Storage: Multiple specialized indexes for different domains:
gcp - Google Cloud Platform docs
bi_tools - Business Intelligence tools
data_indus - Data Industry documents
ai_indus - AI Industry documents
all - Combined knowledge base
Step 2: AI Search Pipeline 🤖
2.1 Embedding Generation

Converts user questions into numerical vectors (768-dimensional)
Uses enterprise AI models for semantic understanding
2.2 Hybrid Retrieval

Vector Search: Finds semantically similar content
BM25 Keyword Search: Finds exact keyword matches
Ensemble Method: Combines both approaches (50/50 weight)
2.3 Cross-Encoder Reranking

Advanced AI model scores query-document relevance
Reorders results by true relevance (not just similarity)
2.4 LLM Response Generation

Large Language Model generates human-like answers
Uses retrieved context to ensure factual accuracy
Automatically includes source links
🔧 Technical Implementation

==================
I'll help you understand all the changes that were made to prepare the DPF FastAPI application for UAT testing. Let me examine the current state of the files and explain what was changed.

Read dpf_config.py, lines 1 to 50

Read .env, lines 1 to 1

Now let me check what the original imports looked like and what cleanup was done:

Read main_serve.py, lines 1 to 50

Now let me check if the .env file has any content (it might be protected):

Read aider_kw_retriever

I notice there's no .env file visible. Let me read the end of the main_serve.py file to see the changes around caching and cleanup:

Read main_serve.py, lines 890 to 931

Based on my analysis of the current code and the conversation summary, here's a comprehensive overview of all the changes that were made to prepare the DPF FastAPI application for UAT testing:

📋 Summary of All Changes Made

BEFORE: API keys were hardcoded directly in the configuration file

AFTER: API keys are now loaded securely from environment variables

📁 2. Environment File Creation (.env)
NEW FILE CREATED: .env file to store API keys securely
This file should contain:
🐛 3. Debug Print Statements Added (main_serve.py)
Key debugging additions:

🧹 4. Code Cleanup (main_serve.py)
Removed redundant imports:

Duplicate from langchain.retrievers import EnsembleRetriever (was imported twice)
Cleaned up unused imports
Simplified logic around line 615+:

Removed redundant code blocks
Streamlined error handling
Consolidated response formatting
Added caching system:

🔧 5. Enhanced DPF API Functionality
Added comprehensive DPF search pipeline:
