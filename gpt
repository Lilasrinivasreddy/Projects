Here’s a clear breakdown of the code changes for “talk to CSV” and where they were made:

1. Talk2ReportAgent (src/agents/talk2report_agent.py)
New Method Added:
answer_question_from_csv:
This async static method takes a user question, finds the most relevant chunk from the uploaded CSV (using embeddings and similarity), and generates an answer using the LLM.
It logs the process, computes the embedding, calls the chunk selection, and returns a structured response.
2. Database Service (service.py)
Chunk Selection Logic:
Added get_most_relevant_report_chunk:
This method fetches all chunks for a given CSV report, computes the similarity between the user’s question embedding and each chunk’s embedding, and selects the chunk with the highest similarity above a threshold.
It returns the best chunk’s text, index, and similarity score.
3. Reports Service (service.py)
Service Layer Update:
Updated ask_question_about_csv:
Now calls Talk2ReportAgent.answer_question_from_csv instead of returning all chunks.
Ensures only the most relevant chunk is used for the answer, and the response is concise and focused.
4. LLM Model Registry (model_registry.py)
Model Selection Fix:
Set the default LLM model to "gemini_pro" (a valid model in your registry) to avoid errors.
5. Parameters Class (model_parameters.py)
Bug Fixes:
Ensured the llm_model attribute is always initialized and available, preventing attribute errors.
6. Pydantic Response Fixes
Sources Field:
Ensured the sources field in the response is always a list of strings, fixing validation errors.
Summary for Your Boss
The new “talk to CSV” feature allows users to ask questions about uploaded spreadsheets and get precise, context-aware answers.
The system finds the most relevant chunk of the spreadsheet using semantic similarity, then generates an answer using the LLM.
The code is modular: agent, service, and database layers are all updated for maintainability and clarity.
Logging and error handling are improved for easier debugging and support.
