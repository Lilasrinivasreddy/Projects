Let me read the current lines 574-599 to understand exactly what's happening in the code and explain the changes we made for the list of strings part.

Read main_serve.py, lines 574 to 599

Perfect! Now I can explain exactly what's happening in lines 574-599. Here's a comprehensive explanation you can give to your lead:

Explanation of Lines 574-599: Context Processing Logic
What This Code Section Does:
This code section (lines 574-599) is responsible for normalizing the input context into a standardized format - specifically, converting it into a list of strings called context_strings that gets sent to the LLM API.

The Problem We're Solving:
The context parameter can come in various formats:

List of strings: ["document1 content", "document2 content"]
List of objects: [{"text_content": "doc1"}, {"text_content": "doc2"}]
Single string: "single document content"
Single object: {"text_content": "content"}
Mixed types: ["string1", {"text_content": "content2"}, 123]
Step-by-Step Breakdown:
1. List Processing (Lines 575-586):
2. Single Item Processing (Lines 587-594):
Key Changes We Made During Our Session:
Evolution 1: Original Complex Logic → Simplified Logic → Back to Context Processing
Started with: Complex nested conditions for logging
Simplified to: Direct context usage (context = context)
Reverted to: Current context processing logic (what you see now)
Evolution 2: Variable Usage in Payloads
Initially: Used context_strings in all LLM API payloads
Temporarily: Used context directly
Final: Back to using context_strings for consistent formatting
Why This Approach Is Important:
1. API Compatibility:
2. Data Integrity:
Extracts actual content from complex objects
Preserves all document content regardless of input format
Handles edge cases (null values, unexpected types)
3. Consistent Output:
Input: [{"text_content": "doc1"}, "doc2", 123]
Output: ["doc1", "doc2", "123"]
Real-World Example:
Benefits for Your Lead:
Reliability: Handles any input format gracefully
Performance: No data loss or formatting issues
Maintainability: Clear, predictable data flow
Debugging: Easy to trace what content is being sent to LLM
This processing ensures that regardless of how the retrieval system sends context data, the LLM always receives clean, properly formatted document content as a list of strings.
