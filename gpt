Step 1: Data Collection
Log and Metric Sources: Collect logs and metrics from various on-premises or external sources (e.g., application servers, system logs, network devices).
Log Collection Agents: Use tools like Apache Kafka or Apache Flume as log collectors on the source systems to gather logs and metrics in real time.
Step 2: Data Ingestion
Ingestion Layer: Set up an ingestion layer using Kafka or Flume to bring the collected logs and metrics into the EDL.
Buffering and Load Balancing: Configure Kafka/Flume to handle buffering and load balancing, ensuring data arrives consistently and reliably in the data lake, even under high load.
Step 3: Storage Layer
Distributed Storage (Hadoop HDFS): Use Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) or a similar distributed storage system as the foundation of your EDL. This will be the primary storage location for raw log and metric data.
Partitioning and Organization: Organize and partition data based on date, log type, or source system to optimize storage and retrieval.
Step 4: Data Processing and Transformation
Batch Processing with Apache Spark or Hive: Set up Apache Spark or Apache Hive for data processing and transformation. These tools enable you to process large volumes of log and metric data efficiently.
Data Cleansing and Aggregation: Cleanse, filter, and aggregate the raw data to prepare it for analysis. You might remove duplicates, normalize fields, or summarize data to reduce storage needs.
Step 5: Data Analytics and Reporting
Data Analysis with Spark or Hive: Use Spark/Hive queries for analyzing log and metric data. These queries can help you identify trends, detect anomalies, or troubleshoot issues based on historical data.
Integration with BI Tools: Connect your data lake to BI tools (e.g., Tableau, Looker Studio, or Power BI) to create visualizations and reports, allowing stakeholders to gain insights into system performance, user behavior, and more.
Step 6: Monitoring and Alerting
Scheduled Queries and Alerts: Set up scheduled queries in Hive/Spark to periodically analyze the data and detect any critical events or patterns (e.g., unusual spikes in logs).
Integration with Alerting Tools: Connect the data lake to alerting systems (e.g., PagerDuty, OpsGenie) to notify teams of any anomalies or significant events detected in the logs.
Step 7: Data Archival and Retention Management
Data Retention Policies: Define retention policies to archive or delete older data based on compliance requirements. For instance, archive data older than one year to separate storage or delete data after a certain period.
Data Archiving: Use HDFSâ€™s archiving features or move older data to a secondary storage system for long-term retention if required.
Summary of Workflow
Collect Logs and Metrics from various sources using Kafka/Flume.
Ingest Data into the EDL using Kafka/Flume, ensuring reliable data transfer.
Store Raw Data in a distributed storage layer like HDFS.
Process Data using Spark/Hive for cleansing, transformation, and aggregation.
Analyze and Report using BI tools for visualization and insights.
Monitor and Alert with scheduled queries and alerting integrations.
Archive and Manage Data Retention to control storage costs and meet compliance needs.
This architecture centralizes log and metric data, providing an end-to-end solution for storage, processing, analysis, and visualization, all within the EDL framework.
