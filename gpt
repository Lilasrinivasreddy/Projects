opentelemetry for observability example sample
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
Here’s a simple example of how to use OpenTelemetry for observability in Python:

1. Install dependencies:
You need to install the OpenTelemetry libraries:

pip install opentelemetry-api opentelemetry-sdk opentelemetry-instrumentation opentelemetry-exporter-otlp
2. Python code example:
import time
from opentelemetry import trace
from opentelemetry.sdk.trace import TracerProvider
from opentelemetry.sdk.trace.export import SimpleExportSpanProcessor
from opentelemetry.exporter.otlp.proto.grpc import OTLPSpanExporter
from opentelemetry.instrumentation.requests import RequestsInstrumentor

# Set up the tracer provider
trace.set_tracer_provider(TracerProvider())

# Set up the OTLP exporter to send data to an OpenTelemetry backend (e.g., Grafana, Jaeger, etc.)
otlp_exporter = OTLPSpanExporter(endpoint="http://your-otel-collector:4317", insecure=True)

# Set up a span processor to export spans
span_processor = SimpleExportSpanProcessor(otlp_exporter)
trace.get_tracer_provider().add_span_processor(span_processor)

# Instrument the requests library (or any other libraries you wish to monitor)
RequestsInstrumentor().instrument()

# Create a tracer
tracer = trace.get_tracer(__name__)

# Example of a trace
with tracer.start_as_current_span("example-span"):
    print("This is a traced request")
    time.sleep(2)

# Example of making an instrumented HTTP request
import requests
response = requests.get("https://httpbin.org/get")
print(f"HTTP response status: {response.status_code}")

Explanation:
TracerProvider: This is the central class for creating and managing spans.
OTLP Exporter: Sends trace data to an OpenTelemetry collector endpoint (you can replace the endpoint with your own service like Jaeger or Zipkin).
SpanProcessor: Processes and exports spans.
RequestsInstrumentor: This integrates OpenTelemetry with the requests library to automatically capture HTTP request details.
3. Set up OpenTelemetry Collector:
The above code assumes that you have an OpenTelemetry collector running at http://your-otel-collector:4317. You can set up the OpenTelemetry Collector to receive, process, and export telemetry data (traces, metrics) to various backends like Jaeger, Prometheus, etc.

For more advanced setups, you might integrate logs, metrics, and further traces into your system based on the service you use.

This is a basic setup to get you started with OpenTelemetry for observability in Python.

ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
To showcase how OpenTelemetry can be used for observability to your manager, you can structure the demonstration to highlight key aspects such as tracing, metrics, and logs, while also emphasizing the ease of integration and the real-time insights that OpenTelemetry provides.

End-to-End Example for OpenTelemetry Demonstration
Project Overview:
You will demonstrate a Python application that:

Tracks Request Flows (Tracing): Show how OpenTelemetry traces the flow of requests through different services.
Collects Metrics: Display how metrics like request counts and response times can be collected.
Generates Logs: Show how logging is enhanced with contextual information (like trace and span IDs).
Exports Data: Visualize the data using an OpenTelemetry Collector connected to Jaeger (for traces) and Prometheus/Grafana (for metrics).
1. Set Up Dependencies
First, install the necessary OpenTelemetry libraries:

pip install opentelemetry-api opentelemetry-sdk opentelemetry-instrumentation opentelemetry-exporter-otlp opentelemetry-exporter-jaeger opentelemetry-exporter-prometheus
2. Define the Python Application
Here is a simple Python application that simulates an HTTP server making external API requests and collecting metrics/logs.

import time
import logging
from flask import Flask
from opentelemetry import trace
from opentelemetry.instrumentation.requests import RequestsInstrumentor
from opentelemetry.instrumentation.flask import FlaskInstrumentor
from opentelemetry.sdk.trace import TracerProvider
from opentelemetry.sdk.trace.export import SimpleExportSpanProcessor
from opentelemetry.exporter.prometheus import PrometheusMetricsExporter
from opentelemetry.exporter.otlp.proto.grpc import OTLPSpanExporter
from opentelemetry.sdk.metrics import Counter, MeterProvider

# Configure Logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)

# Set up Tracing
trace.set_tracer_provider(TracerProvider())
tracer = trace.get_tracer(__name__)

# Set up OTLP Exporter (for traces)
otlp_exporter = OTLPSpanExporter(endpoint="http://your-otel-collector:4317", insecure=True)
span_processor = SimpleExportSpanProcessor(otlp_exporter)
trace.get_tracer_provider().add_span_processor(span_processor)

# Set up Prometheus Metrics Exporter
prometheus_exporter = PrometheusMetricsExporter(port=8000)

# Set up Flask Instrumentation
app = Flask(__name__)
FlaskInstrumentor().instrument_app(app)
RequestsInstrumentor().instrument()

# Set up Custom Metrics (Request Count)
meter_provider = MeterProvider()
meter = meter_provider.get_meter(__name__)
request_counter = meter.create_counter("requests", description="Count of incoming requests")

# Define routes
@app.route("/health")
def health():
    with tracer.start_as_current_span("health-check-span"):
        time.sleep(0.5)
        request_counter.add(1)
        return "OK"

@app.route("/data")
def data():
    with tracer.start_as_current_span("data-request-span"):
        time.sleep(1)
        # Simulate a request to an external API
        response = requests.get("https://httpbin.org/get")
        logging.info(f"External API response: {response.status_code}")
        request_counter.add(1)
        return f"Data Retrieved: {response.status_code}"

# Export Metrics (Prometheus)
@app.route("/metrics")
def metrics():
    return prometheus_exporter.collect()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run(debug=True, host="0.0.0.0", port=5000)
Explanation of the Code:
Tracing: We use OTLPSpanExporter to export trace data to an OpenTelemetry Collector. The FlaskInstrumentor and RequestsInstrumentor automatically instrument the Flask app and requests library for tracing.
Metrics: A simple custom metric (request_counter) counts incoming requests. The PrometheusMetricsExporter exposes the metrics at the /metrics endpoint.
Logging: Integrated logging captures external API responses and traces are linked to the logs using the trace context.
Prometheus Metrics: The /metrics endpoint exposes metrics in a format compatible with Prometheus, which you can use to visualize in Grafana.
3. Configure the OpenTelemetry Collector
Set up the OpenTelemetry Collector to collect and export data. Here’s a simple otel-collector-config.yaml configuration that can be used with Jaeger for traces and Prometheus for metrics:

receivers:
  otlp:
    protocols:
      grpc:
  prometheus:
    config:
      scrape_configs:
        - job_name: 'python-app'
          static_configs:
            - targets: ['localhost:8000']

exporters:
  jaeger:
    endpoint: "http://your-jaeger-collector:5775"
  prometheus:
    endpoint: "0.0.0.0:8889"

service:
  pipelines:
    traces:
      receivers: [otlp]
      exporters: [jaeger]
    metrics:
      receivers: [prometheus]
      exporters: [prometheus]
This configuration allows the Collector to:

Receive trace data via OTLP.
Scrape metrics from the Prometheus endpoint exposed by your application.
Export traces to Jaeger.
Export metrics to Prometheus.
4. Visualize Data
Jaeger (Traces): You can visualize traces in Jaeger to see how requests flow through the system.

Open Jaeger UI and search for traces related to your Python app.
Examine the spans generated for each HTTP request and external service call.
Prometheus & Grafana (Metrics): Use Prometheus to scrape the /metrics endpoint and visualize the metrics in Grafana.

Set up Prometheus to scrape data from http://localhost:8000/metrics.
Create Grafana dashboards to show request counts, response times, and other custom metrics.
5. Run the Application
Run the application:

python app.py
Visit the application:

http://localhost:5000/health to trigger a basic trace.
http://localhost:5000/data to simulate a service call and log it.
Your OpenTelemetry setup will collect and export the data, which can be viewed in Jaeger (for tracing) and Prometheus/Grafana (for metrics).

Final Outcome for the Manager:
Traces: You can demonstrate how OpenTelemetry tracks the flow of requests in real-time across services and external systems. This helps to visualize the entire lifecycle of a request and identify performance bottlenecks.
Metrics: You can showcase how custom metrics like request counts can be used for monitoring the system's health and performance. These metrics are available for visualization in Grafana.
Logging: By integrating logs with tracing, you provide enriched logs that have context about what is happening in the system (e.g., which span or trace generated the log entry).
Scalability and Flexibility: OpenTelemetry can be easily integrated with other observability tools and scaled as your system grows.
This end-to-end example will show how OpenTelemetry can provide deep insights into your application’s performance, errors, and user interactions while maintaining a flexible observability stack.

To integrate OpenTelemetry into Google Cloud Platform (GCP) for observability, you can leverage various GCP services like Google Cloud Logging, Cloud Monitoring, and Cloud Trace to visualize and analyze the traces, metrics, and logs. Below is a guide on how to adapt the OpenTelemetry setup for GCP.

1. Set Up Google Cloud Monitoring and Logging
First, ensure you have access to the Google Cloud project and enable the relevant APIs (Monitoring, Logging, and Trace).

Enable APIs: Cloud Monitoring API, Cloud Logging API, Cloud Trace API.
Set up Google Cloud Storage for storing any long-term data.
2. Use OpenTelemetry with GCP
To send OpenTelemetry data to GCP, you will need to configure the OpenTelemetry Collector to export data to Google Cloud Trace and Cloud Monitoring (which includes Cloud Metrics).

Step-by-Step Integration with GCP
2.1 Install Required OpenTelemetry Libraries
Install the OpenTelemetry dependencies for Python:

pip install opentelemetry-api opentelemetry-sdk opentelemetry-instrumentation opentelemetry-exporter-google-cloud
This installs the OpenTelemetry SDK and the Google Cloud Exporter for exporting trace and metric data directly to GCP.

2.2 Set Up Authentication
You need to authenticate your application with GCP to allow OpenTelemetry to send data to GCP services. The recommended way is by using Google Cloud Service Account credentials.

Create a Service Account in the GCP Console with the necessary permissions for Cloud Monitoring, Logging, and Trace.
Download the JSON key file for the service account.
Set the GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS environment variable to point to this file:
export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="/path/to/your-service-account-key.json"
2.3 Configure OpenTelemetry SDK for GCP
Now, configure OpenTelemetry to export data to Cloud Trace and Cloud Monitoring.

Here’s an example of how to configure tracing and metrics in your Python app:

import time
import logging
from flask import Flask
from opentelemetry import trace
from opentelemetry.instrumentation.requests import RequestsInstrumentor
from opentelemetry.instrumentation.flask import FlaskInstrumentor
from opentelemetry.sdk.trace import TracerProvider
from opentelemetry.sdk.metrics import Counter, MeterProvider
from opentelemetry.exporter.google_cloud import CloudTraceSpanExporter, CloudMonitoringMetricsExporter
from opentelemetry.sdk.trace.export import SimpleExportSpanProcessor

# Set up logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)

# Set up tracing with Google Cloud Trace exporter
trace.set_tracer_provider(TracerProvider())
tracer = trace.get_tracer(__name__)

# Set up Cloud Trace exporter to send spans to GCP Trace
trace_exporter = CloudTraceSpanExporter()
span_processor = SimpleExportSpanProcessor(trace_exporter)
trace.get_tracer_provider().add_span_processor(span_processor)

# Set up custom metrics (request count)
meter_provider = MeterProvider()
meter = meter_provider.get_meter(__name__)
request_counter = meter.create_counter("requests", description="Count of incoming requests")

# Set up Google Cloud Monitoring exporter for metrics
metrics_exporter = CloudMonitoringMetricsExporter()
meter_provider.start_pipeline(meter, metrics_exporter)

# Set up Flask and requests instrumentation
app = Flask(__name__)
FlaskInstrumentor().instrument_app(app)
RequestsInstrumentor().instrument()

# Define routes
@app.route("/health")
def health():
    with tracer.start_as_current_span("health-check-span"):
        time.sleep(0.5)  # Simulate some processing
        request_counter.add(1)  # Increment request count metric
        return "OK"

@app.route("/data")
def data():
    with tracer.start_as_current_span("data-request-span"):
        time.sleep(1)  # Simulate data processing
        # Simulate external API request
        response = requests.get("https://httpbin.org/get")
        logging.info(f"External API response: {response.status_code}")
        request_counter.add(1)  # Increment request count metric
        return f"Data Retrieved: {response.status_code}"

# Run the Flask app
if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run(debug=True, host="0.0.0.0", port=5000)
2.4 Configure OpenTelemetry Collector for GCP
If you are using the OpenTelemetry Collector to centralize data collection from multiple sources, you need to configure it to export to GCP services.

Here’s an example of an otel-collector-config.yaml configuration file to export data to GCP:

receivers:
  otlp:
    protocols:
      grpc:
        endpoint: "0.0.0.0:4317"

exporters:
  google_cloud_trace:
    project_id: "your-gcp-project-id"
  google_cloud_monitoring:
    project_id: "your-gcp-project-id"
  google_cloud_logging:
    project_id: "your-gcp-project-id"

service:
  pipelines:
    traces:
      receivers: [otlp]
      exporters: [google_cloud_trace]
    metrics:
      receivers: [otlp]
      exporters: [google_cloud_monitoring]
    logs:
      receivers: [otlp]
      exporters: [google_cloud_logging]
3. Visualize Data in Google Cloud
3.1 View Traces in Google Cloud Trace
Once the traces are exported, you can view them in Google Cloud Trace.
Go to Google Cloud Console > Trace > Trace Dashboard.
You can see the traces from your application, including latency information, distributed traces, and details of service dependencies.
3.2 View Metrics in Google Cloud Monitoring
Metrics can be viewed in Google Cloud Monitoring.
Go to Google Cloud Console > Monitoring > Metrics Explorer.
Look for the custom metrics like requests and other system metrics.
You can also set up dashboards for real-time monitoring.
3.3 View Logs in Google Cloud Logging
Logs can be viewed in Google Cloud Logging.
Go to Google Cloud Console > Logging > Log Explorer.
You can filter logs by trace ID to see logs associated with specific traces.
4. Bonus: Monitoring with Grafana (Cloud Monitoring Integration)
You can also integrate Google Cloud Monitoring with Grafana to visualize the metrics in more detail.

Set up Grafana with the Google Cloud Monitoring data source.
Connect your Cloud Monitoring to Grafana, and create custom dashboards for your metrics.
This will help you create more sophisticated visualizations for your team.

Summary of How This Works on GCP:
Traces: Sent to Google Cloud Trace, where you can view the end-to-end flow of requests, latency, and service dependencies.
Metrics: Collected using OpenTelemetry and sent to Google Cloud Monitoring, where you can create custom dashboards and alerts.
Logs: Integrated with Google Cloud Logging, providing detailed log insights and trace context for debugging.
Exporters: OpenTelemetry Collectors or SDK directly export data to Google Cloud services for a seamless observability experience.
By following this approach, you can showcase how OpenTelemetry helps improve the observability of applications on GCP, giving your manager a comprehensive view of how the system’s performance can be tracked, monitored, and optimized.
