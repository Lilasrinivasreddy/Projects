Indicator saying if it is confident or not just a true or false, right? 

2

Right, right. 

1

Yes, instead of that.  I mean Along with that we'll have we'll ask another parameter called confidence score.  Yes Yes, it will give you a value between 0 and 1 like 0 .6 0 .5.  How confident is it? 

5
0:17
Right. 

1

Mm -hmm.  Now once you get the confidence score, you can put a threshold Let's say we put a threshold of 0 .7.  Yes, so if Confidence score is going less than 0 .7.  Then we add a retry loop.  Right, right Think of it like an agent, right?  So where you get an answer and you don't like the response of that agent, then you go back and call the other agent.

Or you call back the same agent, right? 

1
0:41
Yes, yes.  So that is happening in flow agent.  In flow agent, where there's this validate query function, right?  In that, first we check if the response is coming from metadata or if it is coming, metadata is in context.  So if it is coming from context, or if it is coming from cache, or if it's coming from history.  So, cache and history it is fine we can ignore that.  When it is coming from context, when layer equals to context in that case there are three validation checks it will do.  One is select query validation, then hallucinations and then execution errors.  Along with these three we will add this fourth condition where it is looking for confidence threshold.  probably you'll add it before the query execution itself, right?  So before the query execution itself, you'll check for the confidence score.  If the confidence score is less than 0 .7, then you recall the LLM saying that, you know, hey, this was the query generated.  This is the confidence score that you gave.  So please regenerate another query, saying that, I mean, you know, asking it to give the confidence score again.

When you get this new query, what we will do is we will do a comparison between the first generated query and the newly generated query. 

1
1:54
Right.

And decide which one to send it back to device.  So, my question was only one thing I mean I got confused over here. 

1
2:06
So, in the layers part right we have to consider only the context one right. 

2
2:13
Only the context layer yes.  Ok I understand at least. 

1
2:17
So, that was a thing I wanted to check.  There are some common checks and also layer based checks right like in the function I think first it is going to do a one first validation check is layer based. 

2
2:30
Okay. 

1
2:30
And then second and third validations are like common for all the layers. 

2
2:33
Okay, okay.  This layer based checks you can add this condition.  Okay Akhilesh sure sure that is what I was little confused on that.  I will try to complete that Akhilesh.  Yeah sure.  And anything other you just let me know to add over this.

I think even here there is a prompts file also we do have right there also should I add Thanks.  Thanks. 

3
3:24
I will work on that. 

3:27
Thank you.  I'm dropping.  Bye.
