🧩 AIDer Conversational Architecture — Explanation
Step 1: User Interaction (Slack Interface)

The conversation starts when a user asks a question through the AIDer Slackbot.

The Slackbot acts as the front-end interface between the user and the backend AI system.

Step 2: Session Handling (Spanner Integration)

The system extracts the session ID and related metadata (like user ID, timestamp, etc.) from the incoming Slack request.

This information is stored in a Google Cloud Spanner table, which acts as the central session store.

If a session already exists, the same session ID is reused — ensuring continuity of conversation across multiple turns.

Step 3: Contextualization of the Question

The system fetches the previous chat history (if any) from Spanner.

Using this, it contextualizes the current question — meaning it understands what the user is asking based on prior exchanges.

The LLM (Large Language Model) helps with this contextualization step, refining the user’s query for better understanding.

Step 4: Knowledge Retrieval (ElasticSearch Layer)

The contextualized query is then sent to ElasticSearch, which contains indexed enterprise knowledge base (KB) documents.

ElasticSearch retrieves relevant content, context, and previous responses that may help in answering the current query.

This forms the retrieval layer of the system.

Step 5: Response Generation (LLM Layer)

The retrieved context from ElasticSearch and the refined user question are passed to the LLM.

The LLM uses this combined context to generate a high-quality, context-aware response.

The output includes both factual content and natural language fluency.

Step 6: Persistence (Save to Spanner)

Once the response is generated, the system saves the session ID, question, and response pair back into the Spanner table.

This allows the model to reference past interactions and maintain continuity across sessions.

Step 7: Deliver Response (Back to Slack)

Finally, the generated response is sent back through the Slackbot.

The user sees the LLM’s reply directly in the Slack conversation window.
